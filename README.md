### Behavior-Driven Analytics & Decision Support System
Conceptual analytics project designing a predictive cart abandonment intelligence system for Amazon. Combines behavioral segmentation, abandonment risk modeling, friction analysis, dashboards, and a scalable roadmap to support proactive, ethical intervention strategies.

---

## Project Overview

This project explores how Amazon could evolve from reactive cart recovery tactics to a **predictive, behavior-driven cart abandonment intelligence system**.

Rather than relying on broad discounts or post-abandonment emails, we design a framework that identifies:
- **Which customers are likely to abandon**
- **Why abandonment occurs**
- **When and how to intervene effectively**

> *This is a conceptual analytics capstone. No proprietary Amazon data or production systems were used.*

## Business Problem

High-intent shoppers frequently abandon carts at the final stage of checkout, resulting in significant lost revenue.  
However, not all abandonment represents lost demand—some behavior reflects browsing, price comparison, or delayed decision-making.

**Core challenge:**  
Differentiate **harmful abandonment** from benign behavior *before checkout* and intervene selectively.

---

## Solution Concept

We propose a **cart abandonment intelligence framework** that combines behavioral analytics, predictive modeling, and executive dashboards to support proactive decision-making.

### Key Capabilities
- Predict abandonment risk in real time  
- Identify behavioral and friction drivers  
- Segment customers by intent and sensitivity  
- Recommend targeted interventions  
- Support scalable and ethical deployment  

---

## Data Strategy (Conceptual)

The solution is designed around first-party behavioral and transactional signals:

- Behavioral session logs  
- Cart activity events  
- Product attributes and price fluctuations  
- Shipping and delivery estimates  
- Review sentiment & friction signals (NLP)  
- Recommendation interaction signals  

All data considerations align with privacy and consent principles (GDPR, CCPA).

## Modeling Approach (Design-Level)

The proposed framework consists of four complementary components:

1. **Behavioral Segmentation**  
   Identify shopper profiles based on browsing and decision patterns  

2. **Cart Abandonment Prediction**  
   Estimate abandonment likelihood using behavioral and friction signals  

3. **Satisfaction & Friction Driver Analysis**  
   Use NLP and feature importance to surface root causes of hesitation  

4. **Intervention Uplift Modeling**  
   Match customer segments with the most effective intervention strategy  

> These models are proposed architectures rather than implemented systems.

## Dashboard Prototype

A conceptual dashboard was designed to help decision-makers answer:
- Who is most at risk of abandoning?
- Which segments require intervention?
- Which products and categories drive friction?
- What actions are likely to increase conversion?

---

## Implementation Roadmap

**Phase 1 (0–4 months):** Behavioral segmentation & pattern discovery  
**Phase 2 (5–8 months):** Dashboard rollout & regional pilots  
**Phase 3 (9–12 months):** Enterprise automation & global scaling  

---

## Ethics, Compliance & Data Quality

The design incorporates:
- Data quality standards (accuracy, timeliness, consistency)
- Bias and interpretability considerations
- Privacy and consent requirements
- Safeguards against manipulative interventions

---

##  Portfolio Value

This project demonstrates:
- End-to-end analytics product thinking  
- Behavioral modeling and segmentation design  
- Executive-level storytelling and dashboards  
- Responsible AI and governance awareness
